# My SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository showcases my SQL skills through various projects involving different databases and query challenges. Each project below demonstrates specific SQL operations and solutions.

- [Project 2: Data Warehousing and ETL](#project-2-data-warehousing-and-etl)
- [Project 3: Complex Joins and Aggregations](#project-3-complex-joins-and-aggregations)

## Project 1: Customer Database Queries
In this project, I created a simple customer database to demonstrate my ability to write basic SQL queries for data retrieval, insertion, updates, and deletion. I have also included complex queries using joins and aggregations.

- Technologies: SQL, PostgreSQL
- Files: [customer_db_schema.sql](project_1/schema.sql), [queries.sql](project_1/queries.sql)

## Project 2: Data Warehousing and ETL
This project focuses on building a data warehouse and performing ETL operations to transform and load data from source systems.

- Technologies: SQL, ETL tools, PostgreSQL
- Files: [etl_process.sql](project_2/etl_process.sql), [schema.sql](project_2/schema.sql)

## Project 3: Complex Joins and Aggregations
This project demonstrates advanced SQL queries, including the use of multiple joins, subqueries, and aggregation functions like COUNT, AVG, and SUM.

- Technologies: SQL, MySQL
- Files: [queries.sql](project_3/queries.sql)
