# Project 2: Customer Database Queries

This project demonstrates the creation and management of a customer database. It includes SQL queries to retrieve customer information, insert new customers, update records, and delete customers. It also demonstrates the use of basic joins and aggregation functions.

## Files
- `schema.sql`: Defines the database structure, including the `customers` table and its relationships.
- `queries.sql`: Contains SQL queries for retrieving and manipulating customer data.
- `data_insert.sql`: Inserts sample customer data into the database.

## Technologies Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL)

## Instructions
1. Create a database using the `schema.sql` file.
2. Use the `data_insert.sql` to insert sample data into the `customers` table.
3. Run the queries in `queries.sql` to retrieve and manipulate customer data.
